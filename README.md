Q4 Capstone Project

For this project, Eric, Jamal, Moe and Rochelle took on the task of creating an application that would aid and assist in keeping track of productivity for both Learners and Coaches.

Our mission was to stream-line the process of accountability with visual confirmation of how productive a group or single user has been, and creating a positive and competetive environment. 

A user can decide for themselves whether or not they want to be a coach or a learner, initiating honesty and accountability upon signup. 

A user can navigate through the website to view other learners and coaches, view a message board, send direct mentions, view profiles, tasks, and efficiency of other users, and view their own efficiency and task list. A learner can add tasks to their list to complete and work on their own produtivity. A coach can add tasks to all profiles to give learners the extra push they need to be successful.
